# Cpp Journey

A catalog and digital journal of Gio Velasco's (that's me!) journey through the understanding and studying of Bjarne Stroustrup's book 'The C++ Programming Language' (fourth edition).

The goal is to become proficient at C++ in order to further strengthen my endeavor with Arduino and Micro-controller programming to eventually take over the world with robot minions.
